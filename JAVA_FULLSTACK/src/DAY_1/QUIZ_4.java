//This code will result in two compilation errors:

//For float f=1.2;: 

//1.2 is a double literal by default in Java. To assign it to a float, 
//you need to explicitly cast it or append f (e.g., 1.2f).

//For boolean b=1;: In Java, you cannot assign an integer value (like 1) to a boolean variable.
//A boolean can only be true or false.
